NOTE: All Scripts and games we did in class are part of TERMINAL EXAM syllabus
1- 3D games objects and their relevant components
   3D GameObjects: Cube, cylider, sphere, 3d assets from asset store.
   2D GameObjects: square, triangle, circle, 2D sprites from asset stores 
   Components: Rigidbody, colliders (box collider, sphere collider etc), audiosource, script, sprite renderer, animator, cinemachine (FOR BSE)
   Material: Bouciness (Physic Material)-->applied on collider material or rigidbody?

2- In 3d game: FootBall ground--> Plain, texture and tiling on plane, 	Parent child concept by making goals, Audio source (Loop, play on awake), how to manage to 
   two ausiosources in one script--> use PlayOneShot(audioclip1)
3- Racing car game--> plane, playercar (had collider, rigidbody, audiosource, car moving script), skybox, traffic cars with moving scripts, building sets on road. Fuel drums 
   which added health to the car, game loop, game end when fuel is zero. Loading new Scene thorugh scenemanager
4- Helicopter game: Terrian (paint texture, raise and lower terrain and add tree), helicopter, object instantiation at random positions, particle system, enemies
   instantiate, colliders on bullets, enemies, and heli. 
5- In 2D game, what is the difference between static and dynamic rigidbody. 
   what is the difference between the gravity scale of 2d and 3d rigidbody 
6- Rigidbody constraint: Freeze position and rotation in XYZ 
7- Mass and gravity factors of ridigbody iN 3D game
8- UI elements, buttons (onclick method needs a gameobject with a script having a public method for button),  image and Text (anchor settings and font of Text)
9- Buttons controls, Why we used public static bool GameMute variable to control audio in all scenes
10- Pause and resume game control
11- FPS game, night mode terrian, lights prefabs, how to unpack a prefab?
12- How to differentiate a normal gameobject with a prefab in hierarchy?
13- 3D Animation control: right from importing animation clips from any outsource to making it part of a state. Trasitions and parameters (bool and trigger)
    for animator.
14- Raycasting
15- Animation Recording
16- 3D Character import and extracting textures
17- CineMachine
18- Visual Scripting


AFTER MID

2D Game DINO GAME.

17- 2D Character sprite identification
18- 2D Character animations--> group of png images are selected and dropped in the scene view, where it is saved as new animation clip and an animator is attached 
    automatically.
19- Grid-->Tilemap-->Tilemap collider.
20- Sorting Layers
21- How to adjust Background, character and tiles in the scene accroding to sorting layers.
22- Character controller 2D script connection with PlayerMovement script. 
23- Saw Movement script
24- Apple collection, and scoring
25- Puzzle game-->rotation of sprites and slicing of images
    On MouseDown()--> through this method you can directly click on the gameobject
    OnTouchStart()--> replacement of OnMouseDown for touch input
    Difference between OnMouseDown() and GetMouseDown()
    OnMouseDown() is only workable with colliders on the gameobject

26- How to pick random number from given list?
	public int[] rotationAngles = {90,-90,180,-180};
        int pickRandom = Random.Range(0,3);
        transform.Rotate(0,0,rotationAngles[pickRandom]);

27- Write steps to create Banner Ad--admob account, google ad plugin, register app, get appid  

28- Multiplayer Game-->Photon Pun Engine account, register app, get app id and paste in photon PUN package

30- NavMeshAgent-->Bake(Windows-->AI) the Terrain and give a target goal to make the character move towards that goal
   using script below:

   using System.Collections;
   using System.Collections.Generic;
   using UnityEngine;
   using UnityEngine.AI;

public class moveTowards : MonoBehaviour
{
    NavMeshAgent agent;
    public Transform goal;
    // Start is called before the first frame update
    void Start()
    {
        agent= GetComponent<NavMeshAgent>();
        agent.destination = goal.position;
    }

    // Update is called once per frame
    void Update()
    {
        
    }
}


Q3- Write 3 different ways image slicing can be used for? --> animations, puzzle game, making tiles.
