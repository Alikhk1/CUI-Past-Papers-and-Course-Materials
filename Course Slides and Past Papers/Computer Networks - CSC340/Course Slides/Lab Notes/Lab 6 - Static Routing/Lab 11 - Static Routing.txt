1. Make the Topology and assign IPs to Routers and PCs

2. Create two routes for network 30.0.0.0/8 and configure the first route (via -Router1) as
the main route and the second route (via-Router2) as a backup route:

Router(config)#ip route 30.0.0.0 255.0.0.0 20.0.0.2 10
Router(config)#ip route 30.0.0.0 255.0.0.0 40.0.0.2 20

	(a). 30.0.0.0 is the network you're trying to access.
	(b). 255.0.0.0 is the subnet mask
	(c). 20.0.0.2 is the next hop, It specifies the IP address of the next router.
	(d). 10 is administrative distance,  used to determine which route should be preferred 
	     if multiple routes to the same destination exist. Lower values indicate higher trustworthiness.

3. Keep adding routes following the syntax, you can also add route for individual device:

Router(config)#ip route 30.0.0.100 255.255.255.255 40.0.0.2 10
Router(config)#ip route 30.0.0.100 255.255.255.255 20.0.0.2 20

Creates two routes for the "server" 30.0.0.100/8 and configure the first route (via -Router2) 
as the main route and the second route (via-Router1) as a backup route.
